# Reference Notes

Institutional knowledge for hard-to-find information. Keep this concise - only document exceptions and gotchas.

## Events & Calendar

- **Don't use**: Calendar view URL (https://gc-cuny.libcal.com/calendar?cid=15537) - HTML format, not parseable

## Library Layout & Services

- **Circulation Desk**: 1st floor (NOT 2nd floor) - source: https://libguides.gc.cuny.edu/visit
- **Copy machines**: 2nd floor, require reusable copy card ($1.00), 15¢/page - source: https://libguides.gc.cuny.edu/librarytech
- **Payment methods**: NO "CUNYcard" system for library services - this is a hallucination
- **Services that DO NOT exist**: "CUNY Book Exchange", "value stations", "CUNYcard payment"
- **Study rooms**: We DO NOT reserve study rooms - do not point to https://gc-cuny.libcal.com/reserve/ as it is unused.
